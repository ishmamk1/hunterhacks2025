      <p>
        Welcome to our app! As Hunter College students, we understand the struggle of finding a quiet and available space to study. 
        That's why we created this appâ€”to help students like us easily locate study rooms and check their availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our app provides tools to see if rooms are crowded or not, so you can plan your study sessions more effectively. 
        We hope this app makes your academic journey a little smoother and more productive!
